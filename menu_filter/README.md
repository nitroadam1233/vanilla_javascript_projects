## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this project.

This was my favorite project to work on. This website filters out everything from breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert. This is a project that you would enjoy looking at if you downloaded it. I created an array of objects in my app.js file that I accessed in order to create this filter app. I hope you enjoy looking at this filter app.
